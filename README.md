# Introduction

A collection of python scripts, for doing Chemical Engineering
Currently only supports **solving** and **drawing** *simple* material balances.
This will however likely change, as the course progresses.

Examples of a few material balances can be seen in [Examples](/examples). And an example of a drawing can be seen below
