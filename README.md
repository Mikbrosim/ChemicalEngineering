# ChemicalEngineering

A collection of python scripts, for doing Chemical Engineering
Currently only supports **solving** and **drawing** *simple* mass and mole balances.
This will however likely change, as the course progresses.

Examples of a few mass and mole balances can be seen in [Examples](/examples). And an example of a drawing can be seen below
